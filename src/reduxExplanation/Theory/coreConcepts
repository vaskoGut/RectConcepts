1. One source of truth:

- in comparison to traditional applications, with store saved in
multipla places. Redux has only 1 place to save state - store.
It makes developer life much easeier. 

2. The read only state
- state changes are predictable. Actions are processed 1 at a time.
Actions are plain objects. It can be easy logged, stored, replayed

3. Reducers are pure functions

- we never modify reducers, they get value and return NEW value.
Reducers like that is also easy to combine
